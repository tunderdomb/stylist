Stylist.js
=========

Extract selectors from files into a stylesheet,
or append them to one, keeping existing rules.
Optionally ignore rules declared in elsewhere,
matched by a glob pattern.

The purpose of this task is to help automate stylsheet creation.
The problem arises when you begin the project with structuring
the markup, and on the way you define classes and ids.
When there's time to create styles for them, you have to rewrite those selectors.

With stylist, you only have to write these selectors once, and set where those stylesheets should be placed.

The intended usage is with alongside a watch task,
so you can just write markup, and have stylist generate the sheets for you.

Stylist also keeps existing sheets, so if you define a new class in a html, the selector will be appended.
This way, you can continuously write selectors and have them generated in stylsheets.

## Options

### options.ignore

Type: `String` | `Array`Ë™

This string, or array of strings should be a set of globbing patterns.
Selectors in matched files will be ignored, and won't be part of the output.

### options.style

Type: `String`

Values: `"css"`, `"less"`, `"styl"`, `"stylus"`, `"sass"`

Default: `"css"`, `"styl"`, `"stylus"`, `"sass"`

Basically the format of the output. You can also select a preprocessor flavor by setting the `ext` expanded options
on the target. Stylist will figure it out from there.
This option is mainly useful if you want to extract selectors as stylus sheets.
Because only stylus has optional braces, the output will omit them too.

### options.classes

Type: `Boolean`

Default: true

Include class selectors in output.

### options.ids

Type: `Boolean`

Default: true

Include id selectors output.

### options.data

Type: `Boolean`

Default: false

Include data attribute selectors in output.
Right now, data attribute values are ignored and won't be part of the output selector.
These two are treated as same:

```html
<input type="text" data-hidden/>
<input type="text" data-hidden="hidden"/>
```

and will output:

```css
[data-hidden]{}
```

## Install

## Usage


```js

grunt.initConfig({
  stylist: {

    // test/collection/hey.html  ->  test\collection\hey.styl
    // test/collection/ho.html  ->  test\collection\hey.styl
    noDest: {
      src: "test/collection/*.html",
      options: {
        ignore: "test/ignore/*.styl"
      }
    },

    // test/collection/hey.html  ->  test\collection\hey.styl
    // test/collection/ho.html  ->  test\collection\hey.styl
    simpleDest: {
      src: "test/collection/*.html",
      dest: "test/collection/",
      options: {
        ignore: "test/ignore/*.styl"
      }
    },

    // test/collection/hey.html  ->  hey.html
    // test/collection/ho.html  ->  ho.html
    expandNoDest: {
      expand: true,
      cwd: "test/collection/",
      src: "*.html",
      options: {
        ignore: "test/ignore/*.less"
      }
    },

    // test/collection/hey.html  ->  test/collection/style/hey.less
    // test/collection/ho.html  ->  test/collection/style/ho.less
    expandDest: {
      expand: true,
      cwd: "test/collection/",
      src: "*.html",
      dest: "test/collection/style/",
      ext: ".less",
      options: {
        ignore: "test/ignore/*.less"
      }
    },

    // test/module/default/default.html  ->  test/module/default/default.less
    expandExt: {
      expand: true,
      src: "test/module/*/*.html",
      ext: ".less",
      options: {
        ignore: "test/ignore/*.less"
      }
    },

    // test/module/mustache/mustache.mustache  ->  test/module/mustache/mustache.styl
    source: {
      expand: true,
      src: "test/module/*/*.mustache",
      ext: ".styl",
      options: {
        ignore: "test/ignore/*.styl"
      }
    }
  }
})

```

## TEST

Test it with [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/).

    mocha

For the assertions [chai assert](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#assert) is used.
